=====================
Future Considerations
=====================

This section outlines enhancements under consideration, but not planned into a specific release. For further details on these please contact Support.

----------------------------
Review of Address Type Code.
----------------------------

Geoscape is proposing to review the current application of Address Type with a view to rationalising the current ADDRESS_TYPE_AUT lookup table to make it more relevant and meaningful with respect to current address contribution.
It is expected that this will likely result in changes to the ADDRESS_TYPE_AUT lookup table as well as the G-NAF Product Description.

------------------------------------------
Changes to Geoscape Cadastre and Property.
------------------------------------------

As noted in the November 2022 G-NAF Release Report, the upgrades to the cadastral and property boundaries in Victoria are ongoing and these changes may to affect address geocodes that are relocated more than 1m from their previous geocode as a result of the boundary upgrades.

--------------------
Further improvements
--------------------

Geoscape will continue to implement further improvements to G-NAF based on additional address contributions from reliable sources. The improvements will be documented at the time of the release where changes are made based on the additional address contributions.
