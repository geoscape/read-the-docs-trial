NSW Flat Numbered Addresses using Hotel Style Numbering
-------------------------------------------------------

In New South Wales, there have been some minor changes in the processing of some flat numbered addresses at address sites identified as using “hotel-style” address numbering. That is, where the flat numbered addresses incorporate both the level number and flat number within the flat number. For example, unit 1 on level 1 would be represented by flat number “101”, unit 1 on level 2 would be represented by flat number “201” and unit 1 on the ground level “G01”.

The changes relate to ground-level units where the flat number is less than 10 with the inclusion of the “G0” (gee zero) in the flat number prefix. This allows for more consistent hotel-style numbering when concatenating flat number attributes as is commonly the case since the zero cannot be incorporated into the flat number field as it is a numeric data type which doesn’t support leading zeros.

Across New South Wales there have been approximately 2,700 updates. Examples of the changes are as follows:
