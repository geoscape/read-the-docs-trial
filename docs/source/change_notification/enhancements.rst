Improvements to address assignment
----------------------------------

Geoscape has improved the link between buildings and addresses. These changes have allowed for more accurate address labels represented in the address attribute within the building_address table. The improvements will have some impact on the total counts within the summary table of this report as well as the address_count attribute within the buildings layer. The total counts may have reductions in certain instances where addresses were previously duplicated.
