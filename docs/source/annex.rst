Annex A - Detailed Statistics by Jurisdiction
=============================================

The following tables show the changes that occur to principal only addresses between the new release (May 2023) and the previous release (February 2023) for each jurisdiction. The table shows information on the change in the two far-right columns, one shows the count difference between two releases (No of Addresses) and the other the percentage of change based on the total of all principal addresses (Address %). The statistics below do not include “retired” addresses (i.e. Confidence = -1).
